Place any custom addons you wish to use in this folder. Please note that this is
*not* the place for GAME addons; this is only for BOT userfunctions.

You must name your main addon file (the one that should be included by the bot) in
the following format: userfunction_name.lua	(where 'name' can be anything you want)
